# Psych 60, Winter 2019
This repository will host resources and tutorials for Psych 60. Please bookmark this site as it will be updated with resources throughout the term.

*Instructor: Jeremy Huckins*

*Teaching assistant: Sarah Herald*

No programming experience is expected for this course, although some will be taught throughout the term and you will be expected to complete an independent project which will involve minimal coding.

# Accessing Dartfs
Data storage: We will host most of our data and tutorials for the class on dartfs. You have a home directory The instructions below are for accessing your home space. If you are enrolled in the class you *should* be authorized to access the Psych 60 space. Please let us know if that is not the case.
